## Key Features

### Patterns screen

No more searching through your phone's files! Have a shortcut to all of your patterns in one list, in one app.

### WIPs screen

Keep track of all of your current projects in neat tabs. Each tab lets you add notes about your project, count the rows, and run a stopwatch so you know exactly how long you've spent on it.

### Shopping list screen

An app for your crafty needs would not be complete without a shopping list! Here you can write down any supplies you might be missing so you don't forget to buy them on your next trip to the store.

## How To Use

To run this app from your computer, you need to have a full React Native development environment. You can find the instructions on the Make sure you have completed the [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) (follow the instructions until "Creating a new application").

Once you have your environment ready, run the Metro Server:

```bash
# using npm
